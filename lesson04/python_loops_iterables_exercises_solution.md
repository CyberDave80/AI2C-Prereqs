# Hands-On: Python Loops and Iterables (Advanced)

These exercises explore key differences between `for` and `while` loops, iterators, and iterable behavior in Python. You'll work with real patterns like filtering, reversing, conditional logic, and manual iteration.

---

### Exercise 1: Print Numbers with a For Loop

**Goal**: Print numbers 10 to 1 using a `for` loop.

```python
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)
```

✅ *Check*: Output should count down from 10 to 1.

---

### Exercise 2: Sum of Numbers with While Loop

**Goal**: Use a `while` loop to sum numbers from 1 to 100.

```python
i = 1
total = 0

while i <= 100:
    total += i
    i += 1

print("Sum:", total)
```

✅ *Check*: Output should be 5050.

---

### Exercise 3: Skip Multiples of 3

**Goal**: Print numbers 1 to 20, skipping multiples of 3.

```python
for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 3 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

✅ *Check*: 3, 6, 9, etc. should be skipped.

---

### Exercise 4: Find First Prime > 100

**Goal**: Use a `while` loop to find the first prime number greater than 100.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = 101
while True:
    if is_prime(n):
        print("First prime over 100:", n)
        break
    n += 1
```

✅ *Check*: Should print 101.

---

### Exercise 5: Reverse a List Without Built-in Methods

**Goal**: Reverse a list using a `while` loop.

```python
original = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_list = []

i = len(original) - 1
while i >= 0:
    reversed_list.append(original[i])
    i -= 1

print(reversed_list)
```

✅ *Check*: Should output `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

---

### Exercise 6: Manual Iteration with Iterator

**Goal**: Use `iter()` and `next()` to manually iterate through a list.

```python
words = ["loop", "list", "range"]
it = iter(words)

while True:
    try:
        word = next(it)
        print(word)
    except StopIteration:
        break
```

✅ *Check*: All words should be printed in order.

---

### Exercise 7: Nested Loop with Tuple Unpacking

**Goal**: Iterate over student records with name and grades.

```python
students = [("Alice", [90, 95]), ("Bob", [85, 88])]

for name, grades in students:
    print(f"{name}:")
    for g in grades:
        print(" -", g)
```

✅ *Check*: Each student should show their name and grades below.

---

### Exercise 8: Filter Even Numbers into New List

**Goal**: Use a `for` loop to create a list of even numbers from 0–20.

```python
evens = []
for i in range(21):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(i)

print(evens)
```

✅ *Check*: Should contain `[0, 2, 4, ..., 20]`.

---

### Exercise 9: While Loop with Complex Condition

**Goal**: Start at 1 and double the number until it exceeds 1000.

```python
n = 1
while n <= 1000:
    print(n)
    n *= 2
```

✅ *Check*: Should print powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, ..., up to 1024.

---

### Exercise 10: For Loop with Enumerate

**Goal**: Print index and value of items in a list.

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

for index, color in enumerate(colors):
    print(f"{index}: {color}")
```

✅ *Check*: Each color should be labeled with its index.


---

### Exercise 11: List Comprehension with Condition

**Goal**: Use a list comprehension to build a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 20.

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 21) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares)
```

✅ *Check*: List should contain squares of 2, 4, 6, ..., 20.

---

### Exercise 12: Dictionary Comprehension

**Goal**: Create a dictionary where the keys are numbers 1–5 and values are their cubes.

```python
cubes = {x: x**3 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(cubes)
```

✅ *Check*: Should print `{1: 1, 2: 8, 3: 27, 4: 64, 5: 125}`.

---

### Exercise 13: Set Comprehension

**Goal**: Use a set comprehension to extract unique vowels from a string.

```python
text = "comprehension in python"
vowels = {ch for ch in text if ch in "aeiou"}
print(vowels)
```

✅ *Check*: Output should be a set of vowels found in the string.

---

### Exercise 14: Generator Expression

**Goal**: Create a generator to yield the square of numbers from 1 to 10.

```python
gen = (x**2 for x in range(1, 11))

for value in gen:
    print(value)
```

✅ *Check*: Each square from 1^2 to 10^2 should print.

---

### Exercise 15: Custom Generator Function

**Goal**: Write a generator that yields Fibonacci numbers up to a limit.

```python
def fibonacci(limit):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a <= limit:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for num in fibonacci(100):
    print(num)
```

✅ *Check*: Should print Fibonacci numbers up to 100.
