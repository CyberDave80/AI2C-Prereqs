# Exercise 1 What's the difference between sort and sorted?
# Which one is a list method and which one is a function that works on lists?


# Exercise 2:
# Write a function that doubles the elements in a list.
# Do you need to return anything here?

# Write a function that doubles the elements in a tuple.
# Do you need to return anything here?


# Exercise 3:
# Rewrite the pop, count, extend, reverse, and sort functions
# Return the results in a new list and do not modify the original list
# (do not use the function you are rewriting)


# Exercise 4
# Fractions can be reprsented by the tuple (numerator, denominator)
# Write a function that adds two fractions
# Write a function that multiplies two fractions
# Write a function that simplifies a fraction


# Exercise 5 write a function to calculate distance between
# two cartesian coordinates
# extension: make it work for more than two dimensions
