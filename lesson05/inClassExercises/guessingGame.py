#Create a guessing game.  Randomly pick a number from 1 to 100 (using the random module).  Continually ask the user to guess the number
#If the user guesses too low, tell them they are too low.  If they are too high, tell them they are too high.  Congratulate
#The user when they guess the number.

#Bonus:  Tell the user how many times they had to guess until they were correct.
