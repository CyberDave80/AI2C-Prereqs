# Hands-On: Git Remotes, Push/Pull, Forking, and Pull Requests

These exercises walk through working with Git remotes and contributing to shared repositories via forks and pull requests.

---

### Exercise 0: Setup Environment

**Goal**: Create a local and remote repository

Do this in your WSL distro for practice on the command line!

1. Create a new folder called `git_example`
2. Change into the new folder
3. Create a new file called `first_file.txt` with some text inside
4. Initialize the git repository
5. Make your first commit

Do this part in GitHub

1. Create a new repository in GitHub under your personal account.
2. After you create the repository, take note of the URL provided.  It should look something like `https://github.com/{username}/{repository-name}.git`

### Exercise 1: Add a Remote Repository

**Goal**: Link your local project to a remote GitHub repository.

This step sets up your local repository to "track" the remote repository under the name `origin`.

```bash
git remote add origin {your_url}
```

âœ… *Check*: Run `git remote -v` to verify the remote is added.

---

### Exercise 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

**Goal**: Push local commits to the remote repository.

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

âœ… *Check*: Visit the GitHub repo and confirm your code appears.

ðŸŽ¯ What does the `-u` flag mean?

Note:  You may be prompted to login.  If you are, follow these steps to generate an access token for your device.

1. Go to User settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-grained tokens > Generate new token
2. Name the token
3. Set an expiration date for the access token.  (Or set it to none if you are using a personal device)
4. Select All Repositories
5. Add Permissions > Contents. Change contents to Read and Write.  Generate the token

Before closing the screen, copy the token, and use it as your password!

### Exercise 3: Pull Changes from a Remote

**Goal**: Sync your local project with changes from the remote.

Two options:

Option 1
1. Give a friend modify rights to your repository in GitHub.
2. Have them clone, make changes, commit, and push their changes to your repository.
3. Then pull their changes using the command below.

Option 2
1. Use the online GitHub editor to make changes to your text file.
2. Then pull the changes using the command below.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

âœ… *Check*: Git should update your local files if there are changes on GitHub.

ðŸŽ¯ Make some new commits locally, and make some new commits on the remote, then pull.  What happens?

### Exercise 4: Fork a Repository

**Goal**: Create your own copy of someone else's GitHub repository.

1. Go to a public GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/shafe123/Spoon-Knife).
2. Click the **Fork** button on the top right.

âœ… *Check*: You should now have a copy under your own GitHub account.

---

### Exercise 5: Clone a Forked Repository

**Goal**: Work on your forked copy locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/Spoon-Knife.git
cd Spoon-Knife
```

âœ… *Check*: You now have a local copy of the forked repo.

---

### Exercise 6: Make a Change and Push to Your Fork

**Goal**: Make a change and push it to your GitHub fork.

Example:
```bash
echo "This is my name!" >> {my name}.md
git add {my name}.md
git commit -m "Added a file from me"
git push origin main
```

âœ… *Check*: Confirm the change is visible in your GitHub fork.

---

### Exercise 7: Create a Pull Request

**Goal**: Submit your change back to the original repository.

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click "Contribute" > "Open pull request".
3. Add a title and description, then click **Create pull request**.

âœ… *Check*: Your pull request should now appear in the original repoâ€™s list of PRs.

---

### Exercise 8: Add an Upstream Remote (Optional)

**Goal**: Keep your fork in sync with the original repository.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/shafe123/Spoon-Knife.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

âœ… *Check*: You can now pull updates from the original repo into your fork.

ðŸŽ¯ What command does fetch and merge in one?
