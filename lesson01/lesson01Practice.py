# Create and use a string called my_str with any value

# Print out the third letter of the string (using an index)

# Print out the last word of the string using index slicing


# Find two string methods besides split from the python documentation
# and use them on your string

# Convert the string to a list and store it in a variable, my_list
# (Look at the slides for an example)


# Research two list methods from the python documentation and experiment
# with their use.  NOTE! Some list methods will give you a new list,
# but other list methods operate on the current list.

# hmmm, what's the difference between my_list.sort() and sorted(my_list)???

# Print out the third letter of the list

# Print out the list in reverse order using index slicing


# Use the dictionary below for the following problems:


# Add a new item to the dictionary using the assignment operator '='


# Add a new item to the dictionary using a dictionary method


# Print out only how many dogs there are


# Write a function that always returns 10


# Write a function that returns the cube of a value


# Write a function that calculates the hypotenuse of a triangle
# hint: remember the Pythagorean theorem, given a and b, calculate c

# Write a function that creates and returns a list from the values 
# of a dictionary that is passed in as an argument
